**Cipher Suites**  
Simpler Cipher Suites  
Only AEAD Cipher (no mac-then-encrypt or encrypt-then-mac)    
Only Forward Secrecy  
RSA is only for Authentication and not for Key Exchange.  
Hashing is Only SHA-265 and above or PolyChacha.  
Divides in to 3 orthogonal choice  
  Key Exchange  (How r we going to establish mutual keys)  
  Authentication  (Who are You)  
  Encryption & Hashing  (How are you going to secure data)  

**Handshake**  

**Session Resumption**  

**Session ReNegotiation**
