- **POODLE**_(Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption)_  
In SSL 3.0 protocol, to encrypts plaintext message, it first creates a MAC and appends the MAC to the message(MAC-then-Encrypt).  
Padding is then added at the end to make the message an integral number of blocks in length.  
Note that padding length is not covered by MAC.  
Also content of padding is also unpsecified, TLS 1.0 specify it.  
In CBC mode  
Bi ⊕ Ei-1 = Mi  
Encrypt(Mi) = Ci  

Now replace Cn by Ci and if server accpets it.  
D(Cn) ⊕ En-1 = 7th Byte  
D(Cn) = 7th ⊕ En-1  
D(Cn) = Mi , because we have replaced it. Mi = Bi ⊕ Ei-1  
Bi ⊕ Ei-1 = 7th ⊕ En-1  
Bi = 7th ⊕ En-1 ⊕ Ei-1  
thats how we can determine last byte of block B. Similary create another block to retrive other bytes by injecting javascript to vary the payload such that 2nd byte fall on boundary.

CVE-ID: CVE­2014­3566  
Mitigation: Disabled SSL3.0 fallback & TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV  
ClientHello cannot be changed as it is cryptographically protected in Finished message.  
Client starts a TLS 1.2 session but an active attacker downgrades the connection to SSLv3.0. SSLv3.0 uses CBC or Stream Cipher RC4 mode.

Aplicable to CBC cipher , suppose we want to know Pi.  
In CBC, Pi is first masked with Ci-1 and then DES/AES is applied to get Ci. This Ci serves as IV for next block i.e. i+1).  
In CBC, we know Ci-1, Ci , suppose we now load a Chosen Plain Text (CPA) for encryption which is  
Ci ⊕ Ci-1 ⊕ Mi  
Ci will cancel out and what we have Ci-1 ⊕ Mi , which is nothing but second block encryption i.e. Ci, if they are equal we know M is correct guess   
In this way we can craft Mi , byte by byte and retrive the plain text.

CVE-2014-0160  
http://heartbleed.com/  
In TLS Handshake, we have payload and length, payload can be 1 byte and length can be 65K.  
openssl implemntation never check length field with actual payload length and blindly return asked length data and thereby leaking information present in openssl memory which attacker shouldnot have known.
